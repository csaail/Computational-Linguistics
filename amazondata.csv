This is a one of the best apps acording to a bunch of people and I agree it has bombs eggs pigs TNT king pigs and realustic stuff,1
This is a pretty good version of the game for being free. There are LOTS of different levels to play. My kids enjoy it a lot too.,1
this is a really cool game. there are a bunch of levels and you can find golden eggs. super fun.,1
"This is a silly game and can be frustrating, but lots of fun and definitely recommend just as a fun time.",1
This is a terrific game on any pad. Hrs of fun.  My grandkids love it. Great entertainment when waiting in long lines,1
This is a very entertaining game!  You don't have to be smart to play it.  I guess that's why I like it...it's easy and fun and that's what games are suppose to be.  Be warned: this game is highly addictive.,1
this is awesome and you don't need wi ti to play trust me. it is really fun and addicting. there are like 100 levels it is even free don't waste your money on the expensive one I mean seriously. get the app,1
this is awesome I bet no one even reads the reviews because they know this game is so good that they don't need to,1
This is basicly the free version but with ads. That's actually awesome!!!! It's addicting and free at the same time really. I'd reccomend it.,1
this is by far the best free app that is available anywhere. it has helped pass the time when nothing else would do. don't pass this one up. PS I hate this 20 word minimum!,1
"This is definitely a great game.  I have to get my 6-year-old grand-nephew to teach me the tricks.  I have figured out some of them, but some configurations are tough to beat.  I don't particularly care spending about 45 minutes  completing a level, but ",1
this. is fun an time consuming. works great on my kindle fire I really like this game so does my btother,1
"This is good if you like physics games, free games, or bird games. Not like free version on ipod. You get all the levels and the only adds pop up in the corner and are barely noticeable.",1
I didn't like it at all .I think it is more for kids. I am really not into many games,0
"I got to the end of he pre-installed version. Confused, I checked online to see that my app was missing an entire level. One post suggested downloading a newer version. It crashes moments after it starts.",0
I hate it they say no at everything l got rid of it when it shut down my kindle it is stupid! !!!!!!!!!????$$$$$*&#9733;&#9733;*&#9733;,0
I hats it never liked it it sucked it was boring I like the Rio one tho that one is good but this just sucked,0
I hear about this app everywhere. Everyone has it on their smartphone or tablet and I see people playing it all the time. This is a terrible app. I played 3 levels before I just couldn't stand it anymore. I hate apps like this Doodle Jump and so many oth,0
"I'll admit, I'm late to the game for getting this wonderful game, but boy am I hooked! What a mindless way to spend hours at a time. Now what will I do when I have to go back to work?",1
"I love angry birds, I have no issue with ad supported games.  I have a real issue with an &#34;ad supported game&#34; that constantly launches full screen ads that last substantially longer than the level you just played.  The in game ads are fine, and w",0
I love the game and levels but I never have time to enjoy how far I get before there is another update that makes me delete the other version with all my progress on it.Now I rarely play it because I always have to play the same levels over and over.Why ,0
I see nothing wrong with this game but I busy don't think it's fun. Shoot a pig with a bird. That's alp you do.,0
it isn't that great it gets too hard and is really frustrating.  I wouldn't get it again. I'm sad I spent the money that I did.,0
